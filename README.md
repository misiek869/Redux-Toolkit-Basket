# Redux Toolkit Basket

This project is based on the Redux Toolkit library, which provides better state management for React. The project utilizes an API created specifically for it. The main functionalities are to add more items to the basket and to remove items from the basket. With every action, the total price changes. It also allows you to clear the entire basket at once. The project is hosted on the Render platform; to access it, you must wait for 30 seconds due to Render's limitations.
